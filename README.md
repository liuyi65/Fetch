User will see the list of meals in Dessert category sorted alphabetically. When they click the list, 
they could see the details including meal name, instructions, ingredients and measurements. This 
Application is developed on iphone 14Pro. You can check the structure of meal and meal list under
Model folder. Check MealsListView and MealDetailView under View folder. Check the API under API folder. 
I had add some comments to explan the meaning of each part. I added some basic alert controller handling
error. There could be some test, the search bar, the pop up window with an animation to indicate loading.
I could add this feature if you want. Thank You.
